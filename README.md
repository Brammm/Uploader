**THIS IS A NON WORKING VERSION. IT NEEDS UPDATING, DOCUMENTATION AND EXAMPLES**

Uploader
========

File uploader that uses the new HTML5 File API for uploading files over Ajax. It falls back to a regular upload with a hidden iframe if there's no support.

**Note:** At the moment this depends on a proprietary JavaScript library that's not included. I will change this to jQuery in the future.
